üé¨ Movie Search App

As a movie enthusiast, building this movie search app was an exciting way to combine my passion for film with coding.

This was my first React project, and it gave me hands-on experience with component-based architecture, state management, and API integration. The app allows users to search for movies in real time and fetches results from the The Movie Database API to display movie titles, posters, and basic info.

My goal was to keep the design simple and responsive, while focusing on core functionality and clean code structure.
